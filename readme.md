# Pomodazzle

Pomodazzle is a simple Pomodoro timer that helps you focus on your tasks.

This app was created using electron, because for some reason the packaging of the corresponding application in java did not work because of the javafx dependencies [Pomodazzle in java](https://github.com/porfanid/Pomodazzle/).

## Features

- Start, pause and reset the timer
- Set the duration of the timer through the settings from the file menu
- Set the duration of the short break and long break through the settings from the file menu

## Installation

To install the app, download the latest release from the [releases page](releases) and run the installer.

## Development

To run the app in development mode, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

There is no src folder because the app was created from scratch and I did not think that creating an src folder would organize the code any better than it is now, although you are welcome to do so if you think it will help you in any way.

This app is in the early stages of development, so any help and/or suggestion is welcome.
