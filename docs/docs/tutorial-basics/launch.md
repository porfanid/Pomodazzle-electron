# Step 3: Launch and Set Up the App


## 3.1 Open Pomodazzle
- Locate and open the Pomodazzle app from your start menu (Windows), or the `AppImage` file (Linux).

## 3.2 First-Time Setup

On the first launch, the app will be initialized with the default work, break and long break values taken from the official Pomodoro guides. You can customize those from the settings.

> **Note:** You can change those settings any time you want, I write this as a first time set up for you to get the hang of the settings window
